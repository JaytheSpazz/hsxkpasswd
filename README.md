xkpasswd.pm
===========

A Perl module for generating secure memorable passwords inspired by the fabulous XKCD web comic. This is the library that drives www.xkpasswd.net

**NOTE:** This is a re-implementation of the first version of XKPasswd, and is far from compelte. It is not usable yet. You can download the original XKPasswd perl module at [www.bartb.ie/xkpasswd](http://www.bartb.ie/xkpasswd)
